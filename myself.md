## **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

### **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** | System Software Engineer
**December 2018 – Present** | StoreOnce Backup/Restore Platform

**Key Achievements:**
- **Multi-threaded Architecture:** Redesigned thread pool for SQL Catalyst Plugin, reducing memory footprint by 40% through optimized thread lifecycle management and connection pooling
- **Lock-free Programming:** Implemented lock-free data structures for high-throughput backup streams, achieving 3x performance improvement in concurrent operations across 15+ backup sessions
- **Memory Leak Resolution:** Identified and fixed 5+ memory leaks in RMAN and SAP-HANA plugins using Valgrind and custom memory tracking, eliminating crashes during long-running operations
- **RAII & Smart Pointers:** Implemented comprehensive smart pointer adoption across legacy codebase, reducing memory-related defects by 60%
- **Deadlock Prevention:** Resolved critical race conditions through fine-grained locking, lock ordering protocols, and timeout mechanisms

**Projects & Technologies:**
- **SQL Catalyst Plugin (C++ / Windows Server):** Thread-safe communication layer with reader-writer locks enabling parallel backup streams; optimized memory allocation for streaming data
- **SAP-HANA Catalyst Plugin (C++ / Linux):** Multi-threaded backup orchestration with condition variable synchronization; fixed memory leaks in connection pooling
- **RMAN Plugin (C++ / Linux & Windows):** Refactored single-threaded code to support concurrent backup channels; resolved memory corruption in shared buffer access
- **Install-Update Component (C++ & Java / Linux):** Concurrent upgrade framework with barrier synchronization; fixed memory leaks in rollback mechanisms
- **Modular Update System:** Component-level upgrade architecture with fine-grained concurrency control for zero-downtime updates
