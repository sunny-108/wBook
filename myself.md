## **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

### **Hewlett Packard Enterprise** | System Software Engineer

**December 2018 – Present** | StoreOnce Backup/Restore Platform

**Key Achievements:**

- **Modern C++ Thread Pool Refactoring:** Modernized legacy Windows API thread pool to C++14/17 standards by replacing Windows Events with `std::condition_variable`, migrating mutexes to `std::mutex`, adopting `std::thread` for portability, and implementing smart pointers for automatic resource management; improved code maintainability while preserving performance characteristics
- **Design Patterns & Architecture:** Implemented Command pattern for job execution, Object Pool pattern for thread lifecycle management, and Singleton pattern for global resource coordination; redesigned entire business logic layer with thread-safe resource management and free-thread detection algorithm for efficient job dispatching
- **Memory Leak Resolution:** Identified and fixed memory leaks in RMAN and SAP-HANA plugins, eliminating crashes during long-running operations; resolved concurrent backup expiration failures by implementing process-level mutex, eliminating race conditions in credential file access
- **RAII & Smart Pointers:** Implemented comprehensive smart pointer adoption across legacy codebase, reducing memory-related defects

**Projects & Technologies:**

- **SQL Catalyst Plugin (C++ / Windows Server):** Achieved 25% memory reduction through optimized thread lifecycle and COM interface management
- **SAP-HANA Catalyst Plugin (C++ / Linux):** Multi-threaded backup orchestration with parallel stream processing; implemented IPC command pattern for backint interface; resolved concurrent backup expiration failures by implementing process-level mutex, eliminating race conditions in credential file access
- **RMAN Catalyst Plugin (C++ / Linux & Windows):** Refactored single-threaded SBT 1.0 to multi-channel SBT 2.0 architecture with context manager for parallel tablespaces; resolved critical memory corruption (7.8 GB leak) in shared buffer access using state machine and ThreadSanitizer verification
- **Install-Update Component (C++ & Java / Linux):** Concurrent upgrade framework for StoreOnce
- **Modular Update System:** *Lead the team of 4 Engineers,* designed & developed component-level upgrade architecture for StoreOnce

### **Capgemini** (Client: Hewlett Packard Enterprise) | Consultant

**July 2014 – November 2018** | StoreOnce Plugin Development (C++ / Windows Server)

**Key Achievements:**

- **Custom Thread Pool Architecture:** Designed and implemented production-grade thread pool from scratch using Producer-Consumer pattern with configurable worker threads (1-4), event-based synchronization via Windows API (CreateEvent, WaitForMultipleObjects), mutex-protected job queues (std::list), and RAII-based lock management for exception-safe concurrency;
- **Memory Optimization:** Resolved COM interface and database connection memory leaks using RAII wrappers; optimized large transaction processing through streaming APIs and buffer reuse; achieved 40% memory footprint reduction through optimized thread lifecycle and connection pooling
- **Hybrid C++/CLI Architecture:** Integrated native C++ core with .NET CLR for ADO.NET database access and managed code interop; implemented marshalling layer for seamless string/data conversion between native and managed contexts
- **Catalyst Plugin Installer Framework (Java / InstallAnywhere 2017):** Lead the team of 4 Engineer. Architected and developed enterprise-grade installer supporting 6 plugins (SQL, RMAN, SAP-HANA, NBU-OST, BE-OST, D2D-Copy) across 5 platforms (Linux, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Windows); implemented design patterns including Singleton for pre-flight check runners, Factory for platform-specific checkers, Strategy for plugin-specific validation, and Command for install/uninstall/upgrade operations; designed modular pre-flight validation framework with platform-agnostic interface, safe upgrade mechanism with file migration to temporary directory and rollback support, and multi-interface support (GUI/Console/Silent mode)
- **Race Condition Fixes:** Debugged and fixed race conditions in multi-threaded backup state management using critical sections and mutex hierarchies; implemented event-based thread signaling to eliminate polling overhead
- **Memory Profiling:** Conducted heap profiling using Visual Studio diagnostic tools and Windows Performance Analyzer

**Technologies:** C++14, C++/CLI, Visual Studio 2008/2010, MS SQL Server 2012/2014/2016, ADO.NET, Windows API (Threading, Events, Mutexes), Windows Task Scheduler COM API, RapidJSON, Valgrind
