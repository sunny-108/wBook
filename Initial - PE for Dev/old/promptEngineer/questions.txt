Book: Prompt Engineering for Developers: Crafting Intelligent LLM Solutions

Who is the primary audience you envision for your book, 
and what specific challenges or knowledge gaps are you aiming to solve for them?

The primary audience is developers, data scientists, who want to leverage large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. 
The book addresses practical challenges such as effective prompt engineering, integrating LLMs into workflows, debugging, cost optimization, 
and designing robust LLM-powered systems—bridging the gap between theory and hands-on implementation.


What teaching philosophy or approach did you employ when structuring your book's content 
to ensure maximum clarity and learning?

The book uses a hands-on, example-driven approach, starting from foundational concepts and building up to advanced system design. 
Each chapter introduces practical scenarios, step-by-step solutions, and real code, ensuring readers can immediately apply what they learn. The structure emphasizes clarity, incremental learning, and actionable insights.


If you could give one piece of advice to someone just starting in data science or software development, 
based on your 15 years of experience, what would it be, and how does your book expand on that advice?

Focus on building a strong foundation in problem-solving and always seek to understand the "why" behind tools and techniques. 
My book expands on this by not just teaching prompt engineering syntax, but by explaining the reasoning, trade-offs, and best practices behind each approach—empowering readers to adapt and innovate as the field evolves.
